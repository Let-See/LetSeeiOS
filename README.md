## What is wrong with Xcode console?

Many applications need to handle API calls and communicating with servers. The problem is by logging API calls (requests and responses) in **Xcode's console**, you see a very **crowded terminal, nasty and confusing** information moreover for a peace of data, you have to look through all printed texts in terminal alongside with **interface issuess, library warnings, other logs** and more ... within a very ordinery, unorgenaized and pale color place. Are you tired of this?
