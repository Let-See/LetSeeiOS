# LetSee

Many applications need to handle API calls and communicating with servers. The problem is by logging API calls(requests and responses) in Xcode's console, you see a very crowded terminal, and you have to find information which you look for in a very dirty and crowed place without any color and organization. Are you tired of this?



By LetSee, you can look for what ever you want in a very neat and clean space. Do you like this?


Using it is very easy, you can just import it and log function.Â
